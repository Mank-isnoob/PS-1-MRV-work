# Analysis over vision-based models for pedestrian action anticipation

##Models and their comparision based on their performance


1. I3D Model: The I3D model is a 3D CNN architecture that serves as the backbone for the I3D-Trans model. It processes a sequence of 3D images in temporal order to reduce the temporal dimension. The I3D model incorporates pretrained inception modules and has been trained on the Kinetics human action dataset. It is primarily designed for video processing and has shown promising results in action recognition tasks .
2. ViVIT Model: The ViVIT model is a vision-based model that combines the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale dataset for image classification. The ViVIT model is then fine-tuned on the PIE dataset, which is specific to pedestrian action anticipation. The ViVIT model has demonstrated strong performance, particularly in challenging scenarios where other models may struggle .
3. Inception-Trans Model: The Inception-Trans model is a hybrid model that combines a Transformer head with a CNN network. It is trained from scratch on the PIE dataset, which means it does not rely on pre-training on other datasets. The Transformer head of the Inception-Trans model is specifically trained on the PIE dataset to capture spatial dependencies and predict pedestrian actions. However, the paper suggests that attaching a Transformer head to a CNN network may potentially impair overall performance .
4. I3D-Trans Model: The I3D-Trans model is proposed in the paper as a novel architecture for action anticipation. It combines the I3D backbone with Transformers. The model condenses the temporal dimension of a sequence of 3D images into a single image using the I3D architecture. Then, it encodes spatial dependencies using a 2D Transformer. Finally, the output of the Transformer is fed into a classification head to predict pedestrian actions. The specific performance of the I3D-Trans model is not mentioned in the provided texts .

These models are designed to anticipate pedestrian actions based on visual input and have different architectural configurations and training strategies.


##The paper discusses the performance of different models in the context of pedestrian action anticipation. Let's go through each model and their success:

1. I3D-Trans Model: The I3D-Trans model is proposed in the paper and combines the I3D architecture with Transformers. It condenses the temporal dimension of 3D image sequences, encodes spatial dependencies using a 2D Transformer, and predicts pedestrian actions. Unfortunately, the paper does not provide specific details about the success or performance of the I3D-Trans model.
2. ViVIT Model: The ViVIT model is mentioned in  as one of the top-performing models. It achieves the highest accuracy ratio (39.3%) in situations where other models, such as the I3D model and Inception-Trans models, fail. This indicates that the ViVIT model is more effective in predicting challenging scenarios with greater accuracy.
3. I3D Model: The I3D model is mentioned in  as one of the top-performing models. It serves as the backbone for the I3D-Trans model and utilizes inflated CNN branches that incorporate pretrained inception modules. The I3D model has been trained on the Kinetics human action dataset, which contributes to its performance.
4. Inception-Trans Model: The Inception-Trans model is also mentioned in . It is a hybrid model that combines a Transformer head with a CNN network. However, the paper suggests that attaching a Transformer head to a CNN network could potentially impair overall performance. The Transformer head of the Inception-Trans model was trained from scratch on the PIE dataset.

Overall, the ViVIT model and the I3D model are mentioned as the top-performing models in the analysis. However, the paper does not provide detailed performance metrics or comparisons between these models.


##Datasets used to train the models

1. Kinetics Human Action Dataset: The Kinetics human action dataset is a large-scale dataset for human action recognition in videos. It contains around 400 human action classes and over 300,000 video clips. The I3D model, which serves as the backbone for the I3D-Trans model, is pre-trained on this dataset .
2. ImageNet Dataset: The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale dataset for image classification. It contains over 1.2 million images with 1,000 object categories. The ViVIT model is pre-trained on this dataset before being fine-tuned on the PIE dataset .
3. PIE Dataset: The PIE dataset is a dataset specifically designed for pedestrian action anticipation. It contains around 5,000 video clips of pedestrians performing various actions, such as walking, running, and crossing the street. The Inception-Trans model and the I3D-Trans model are trained from scratch on this dataset .

#Actions that were detected using the models

The PIE dataset, which is used for training and evaluation, contains video clips of pedestrians performing various actions. These actions may include walking, running, crossing the street, and potentially other actions that pedestrians commonly engage in. The models are trained and evaluated to anticipate and predict these pedestrian actions based on visual input.
The type of actions that were specifically detected using the model are not mentioned the paper but based on the dataset that was used to detect the model can be inferred that they trained on detecting basic actions.

##Future Prospects

1. Autonomous Vehicles: Predicting pedestrian actions can help autonomous vehicles anticipate and avoid potential accidents, which can improve road safety and reduce the number of pedestrian fatalities in urban areas. The paper suggests that pedestrian action anticipation is a crucial component of autonomous vehicle technology .
2. Human-Computer Interaction: The paper suggests that explainable pedestrian action anticipation models can help build trust and understanding between humans and autonomous systems. This can improve human-computer interaction and facilitate the adoption of autonomous systems in the future .
3. Surveillance and Security: Pedestrian action anticipation can also be used for surveillance and security purposes, such as detecting suspicious behavior or identifying potential threats in public spaces .
4. Robotics: The paper suggests that pedestrian action anticipation can also be applied to robotics, such as predicting the movements of pedestrians in a shared workspace to ensure safe and efficient collaboration between humans and robots .

How V2x communications be used with the above technology?

V2X communications enable vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians in real-time. This can provide additional information to pedestrian action anticipation models, such as the location and speed of nearby vehicles, the status of traffic lights, and the presence of other pedestrians. By incorporating this information into the models, they can make more accurate predictions and avoid potential collisions.
For example, V2X communications can be used to detect and predict the movements of pedestrians who are not visible to the vehicle's sensors, such as pedestrians who are obstructed by buildings or other objects. This can help the vehicle anticipate and avoid potential collisions with these pedestrians.
Additionally, V2X communications can be used to provide warnings and alerts to pedestrians and drivers in real-time. For example, if a pedestrian is about to cross the street and a vehicle is approaching, the vehicle can send a warning signal to the pedestrian to alert them of the potential danger.
