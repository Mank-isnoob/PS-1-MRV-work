**Project Report: V2X Pedestrian Safety**

**Abstract:**
This project aims to enhance pedestrian safety through the implementation of a V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication system. The focus is on object classification, collision possibility assessment, and alert generation using computer vision techniques. The proposed methodology utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection and classification. The system aims to identify and classify road objects as cars and pedestrians, estimate their speeds, assess collision possibilities, and generate alerts to prevent accidents at crosswalks.

**1. Introduction**
Ensuring pedestrian safety is a critical concern in road traffic scenarios. V2X technology enables real-time communication between vehicles and the surrounding environment, facilitating the exchange of information for enhanced safety. This project aims to leverage computer vision techniques and V2X communication to improve pedestrian safety.

**2. Literature Review**
Extensive research papers related to V2X pedestrian safety were analyzed to gain valuable insights into the methodologies and approaches used in this field. Notable contributions from renowned researchers were studied to identify gaps and potential areas for improvement.

The findings from the literature review revealed the following key insights:

- Li, et al. (2018) proposed a V2X-based pedestrian safety system utilizing vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving pedestrian safety through timely warnings.
- Wang, et al. (2019) focused on deep learning techniques for pedestrian detection in V2X systems, comparing different models and highlighting the superior performance of YOLO in real-time object detection.
- Li, et al. (2020) proposed a collision warning system for pedestrian safety in V2X environments, combining pedestrian detection algorithms and trajectory prediction models to estimate potential collisions between vehicles and pedestrians.
- Zhang, et al. (2021) explored the integration of V2X communication with intelligent traffic signal control systems to enhance pedestrian safety at intersections.
- Chen, et al. (2022) developed an intelligent V2X-based pedestrian crossing system, using computer vision techniques to detect pedestrians and analyze their crossing intentions.

**3. Methodology**
The proposed methodology includes the following steps:

- Object Classification: The YOLO algorithm is employed for the detection and classification of road objects, specifically cars and pedestrians. YOLO's efficiency and accuracy make it well-suited for real-time object detection.
- Speed Estimation: Utilizing YOLO, the system estimates the speeds of detected cars and pedestrians based on their motion patterns and trajectories.
- Collision Possibility Assessment: Using the estimated speeds, the system assesses the possibility of collisions between cars and pedestrians at crosswalks.
- Alert Generation: When a potential collision is detected, alerts are generated to warn both the car driver and the pedestrian, allowing them to take preventive actions and avoid accidents.

**4. Experimental Results**
The proposed methodology was tested using various stock images containing cars and pedestrians. The YOLO algorithm exhibited superior object detection accuracy compared to other methods such as Mobile_SSD. YOLO successfully identified almost all objects on the road, including cars and pedestrians, with high precision and recall.

**5. Future Plans**
Based on the promising results obtained, the project will expand into the following areas:

- Speed Estimation Refinement: Further research will focus on improving the accuracy of speed estimation for both cars and pedestrians.
- Collision Avoidance System: Integration with additional sensors, such as radar and LiDAR, will enable more comprehensive collision detection and avoidance capabilities.
- Research Integration: The project aims to integrate findings from previous research conducted by renowned scientists, enhancing the credibility and effectiveness of the proposed system.
